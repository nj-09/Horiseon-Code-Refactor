# Challenge-1 - Horiseon-Code-Refactor

In this first challenge, I have attempted to make an existing website more accesible for people with disabilities. 
As, I'm deaf, it is useful having accessible content that provides ease of usage for the user with additional needs. 
Learning the development of creating an inclusive website by changing non-semantic to semantic HTML elements was an insightful process.

## Installation
I used an existing starter code provided to me by my bootcamp. I first created a new repository on GitHub, cloned the repository to my local machine and used the git add . command to recognise whether or not the files have been connected.

An example of the challenge where the "Top Section" having a comment workflow to organise changes and understanding the reason why changes were made.

## Credits
I used a website called W3Schools to understand the different meanings of semantic and non-semantic elements, as well as their appropriate usages within my challenge.
